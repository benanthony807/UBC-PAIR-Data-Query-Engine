// can assume HTML elements will always be in the same form as in the zip file
// can't assume there's only one <table> in a file, but
    // can assume that whatever table has the building data is the only oen with room data in that file
// elements might be in different locations between diff HTML trees
// get lat/lon using http, and URL encoded address, have to match how the address is
    // in the data file exactly
// to get the address pretty sure we just use the http GET method
